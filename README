This is a blog-cv website created by me, to exhibit my professional experience while practicing frontend (HTML, CSS) and backend (Python) technologies.
Doing is the key to understanding I believe, so instead of creating a CV with Word, I wanted to create my own cv-like website and understand how frontend and backend works together.

I am aiming to update the website with new features, news about projects, certifications, etc.

Frameworks and libraries used:

 - Flask
 - Flask-SQLAlchemy
 - Flask-WTF
 - Flask-Bootstrap
 - Flask-Login
